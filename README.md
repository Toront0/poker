# Poker

Poker is a fullstack web game.

Note - This is not finished version of the project. If you want to be a contributor, you can add some functionality, improve algos or fix any bugs.

Client side was written primarily on React - [github repo](https://github.com/Toront0/poker-client)

Live demo available [here](https://poker-client-eight.vercel.app/)

P.S. Server deployed on [render.com](https://render.com), and it's working on free tier, so it delays requests on 50 seconds or more, and server may take a long time to respond.
